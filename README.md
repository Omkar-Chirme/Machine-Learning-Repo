# Heart Disease Project

This project was created as capstone project for an internship provided by YBI foundation. In this project I have created a model for prediction of Heart Disease in a patient based on the dataset. 

Dataset used in this model is open sources on kaggle dataset website. 

**Dataset Link** : https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

**Algorithm used**:
In this project i have used 4 different algorithm to compare thier result and get highest accuracy. I have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN Classifier. 

I have explained all details in this .ipynb file for each steps and discussed result.
